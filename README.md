# Springboard-Racial-Discrimination-II

This is an exercise to check for racial discrimination among the test applications sent out for the experiment. The source for the data can be found here: https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/discrimination-job-market-united-states .

The exercise includes hypothesis testing and finding a confidence interval for those results. After that, other factors for discrimination were checked, such as sex. Non-discriminatory factors for not recieving a callback were also checked, like education and year of employment.

Other trends were found among these factors. Therefore I was unable to conclude that race was the most important factor for determining callback success.

This is a repost of the Springboard Racial Discrimination Exercise repository. That repository was showing the code vertically, which was difficult to read and unwanted.
